        cow.sound(); // With the same method name, we are just replacing the method existing, but this one returning a different string. -> "The cow says: moo moo"

        dog.sound(); // The Dog class has 2 methods with the exactly same name "sound", but one of them have a parameter to be passed on your call, which will return a different result if a string is passed. -> "The dog says: woof woof"

        // But it makes harder to read your code.
