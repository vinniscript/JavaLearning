//        Static = modifier. A single copy of a variabel/method is created and shared.
//                  The class "owns" the static member.

        System.out.println(friend2.numberOfFriends);
        // it works that way because the 'static' keyword on the beginning of the declaration of the variable makes that statement be accessible by all the class. If you try to remove the static word, you're going to have an error.
        // itÂ´s like when you declare something that is static, you are creating a global copy of that thing, which any object of that class will have access to its value

        Friend.displayFriends(); // We cannot do this if our method is not static. If it's only defined like 'public void' you would need to create an object of it, so then you would be able to call its methods.

        int arrendondacao = Math.round(a); // This is a static method of java. That's why you can just summon it in the middle of your code without defining anything else.
        System.out.println(arrendondacao);
        // That's the basics of the static method.
